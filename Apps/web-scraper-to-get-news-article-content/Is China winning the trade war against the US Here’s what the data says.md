            The yearslong trade war between China and the United States was amplified in February 2025 when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the Asian nation, Canada and Mexico on February 1. Since then, the two countries have been entangled in a chaotic relationship, with tit-for-tat tariffs at times reaching triple-digit levels.
    
            But after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea last Thursday to discuss trade and other issues, Trump agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% in exchange for promises that Beijing will crack down on the flow of fentanyl into the US. The effective tariff rate will still stand at around 47% for Chinese goods entering the US.
    
            But how is China doing since Trump started his second term as president and tariffs have been levied worldwide? Here’s what the data says.
    
            Even before Trump’s second term, China’s exports to the US had been declining. That’s accelerated even more over the past few months.
    
            In September, exports to the US totaled $34.3 billion, compared with $47 billion in the same month last year – down 27%.
    
            But despite this steep decline in trade with the US, Chinese exports are up 6.1% this year, with September data showing an 8.3% increase compared with a year earlier, as exports to other areas surged.
    
            China is not only diversifying its exports but is also importing more products from other countries as it looks to alternatives to American goods.
    
            Soybeans, a key commodity for both China and the US, were a big part of trade negotiations.
    
            Although Chinese imports of American soybeans have been declining consistently in the past few months, for the first time in years, China didn’t import any soybeans from the US in September. Instead, China has turned to Brazil and Argentina, where soybean shipments to China continue to grow. In September, the Argentinian government temporarily suspended its soybean export tax, prompting the Chinese government to buy about 1.2 million metric tons from the South American country.
    
            Chicago soybean futures, which track global soybean prices, rose earlier this week ahead of talks between Xi and Trump. After the meeting between the two leaders, China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season and committed to buying 25 million metric tons annually for the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Thursday.
    
            Meanwhile, China, the third-biggest buyer of American beef, has been purchasing much less of the commodity in recent months. From January to July of this year, the country purchased $481 million worth of American beef, accounting for 8% of US beef exports, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. That’s a 47% decline compared with the same period last year, when Chinese purchases of American beef accounted for 15% of overall beef exports.
    
            As is the case with soybeans, China has filled the void by increasing purchases from other countries, namely Australia and Argentina, after China failed to renew beef contracts with the US earlier this year.
    
            Chinese imports of American beef have continued to drop. Last month the country purchased $11 million worth of American beef, a 90% decline compared with September of last year, when it purchased $110 million worth of American beef, according to data published by China’s General Administration of Customs.
